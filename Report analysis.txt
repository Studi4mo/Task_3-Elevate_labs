*** Medium-Severity Findings ***

SMB Signing Not Required
Plugin ID: 57608
CVSS v3.0: 5.3
SMB message signing is disabled, allowing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or session hijacking.

-----Impact: Attackers could intercept or tamper with SMB communications.-----

Mitigation:
Enable SMB signing via Group Policy:
Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Options → "Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)".

mDNS Detection (Remote Network)
Plugin ID: 12218
CVSS v2.0: 5.0* (v3.0 unavailable)
mDNS service is active and discoverable from remote networks.

----Impact: Exposes device details (e.g., hostname, services) to unauthorized users.--------

Mitigation
Disable mDNS if not required.
Restrict mDNS to trusted networks using firewall rules.
